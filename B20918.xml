         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But they are Men of <hi>weak Souls,</hi> deſtitute of <hi>diſtinct</hi> thoughts; who deny <hi>all,</hi> becauſe they have diſcovered Error <hi>in ſome;</hi> or condemn as falſe, <hi>all facts,</hi> which they are <hi>ignorant how</hi> they came to exiſt: By the <hi>ſame rule</hi> of reaſoning that, there are no <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> becauſe the beſt Men have been ſome times miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for theſe; nor are there any <hi>Criminals,</hi> in reſpect ſeverals have ſuffered who were not truely ſuch: conſidering, that many <hi>Hiſtorys</hi> are fabulous, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none is to be truſted: And all the <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> in Nature, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible cauſes they cannot comprehend, are meer Deluſions.</p>
            <p>The following narrative, as to the truth of Fact, is the beſt attested peice of Hiſtory of this kind, that has occurred in many Ages: the moſt of the matters therein repreſented having gained the aſſent of <hi>privat Scepticks;</hi> and been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before <hi>publick Judges.</hi> So that it's more ſurpriſing than the ſtrange things of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> that any ſhould ſeriouſly deny the <hi>Beeing thereof,</hi> and from thence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit ſuch uſeful Providences <hi>at a diſtance,</hi> when <hi>Notoriety</hi> has diſpelled all Objections in the places where they did exiſt.</p>
            <p>Many Authors have proven, at large, that there are Witches and witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft from <hi>Reaſon, Scripture, Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> or all Nations and Ages in the World: And they have <hi>ſolved the difficultys</hi> which might obſtruct the belief of this <hi>poſitive proof,</hi> by <hi>poſſible Hypotheſes</hi> of Philoſophy: Where it's to be obſerved, that tho any ſuch explications of the natural manner of Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena's are ſubject to cavil, yet the exiſtence of a thing which has ſo certain <hi>poſitive Evidence</hi> cannot be denyed in ſound Reaſoning; becauſe, <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> not being made for <hi>civill converſe</hi> together in <hi>this</hi> World, and all <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>Devils</hi> being interdicted us, the Scripture <hi>needed</hi> to unfold little of their <hi>way</hi> of acting; and ſtill the <hi>next</hi> Age, may diſcover what <hi>this</hi> could not reach, As this has already unveiled what was thought unextricable in the <hi>Laſt:</hi> Unleſs <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> were preſently <hi>demonſtrate.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Saturnday</hi>-night thereafter, being <hi>Auguſt</hi> 22. the Child went to Bed in good health; but ſo ſoon as ſhe fell aſleep, began to ſtruggle and cry, <hi>Help, Help:</hi> And then ſuddenly got up, and did fly over the top of a Refting-bed, where ſhe was lying (her Father, Mother, and others being in the Room, and to their great Aſtoniſhment and Admiration) with ſuch violence, that probably her Brains had been daſht out, if a Woman, providentially ſtanding by, and ſupported by a Door at her back, had not broke the force of the Childs motion; who being laid in another Bed, remained ſtiff and inſenſible as if ſhe had been dead, for the ſpace of half an Hour; but for Fourty eight Hours thereafter could not ſleep, crying out of violent Pains thorow her whole Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no ſooner began to ſleep or turn drowſie but ſeemed greatly affrighted, crying ſtill <hi>Help, Help.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But about the midle of <hi>September,</hi> her fits returned in a manner <hi>differing</hi> from the former, wherein ſhe ſeemed to fight and ſtrugle with ſome thing that was inviſible to ſpectators, and her Action appear'd as if ſhe had been defending her ſelf from ſome who were aſſaulting or attempting to hurt her, and this with ſuch force that four ſtrong Men were ſcarcely able to hold her; and when any of the People preſent toucht any part of her Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe did cry and ſchreek with ſuch vehemence, as if they had been killing her, but could not ſpeak</p>

            <p>Some dayes thereafter was an alteration in her Fitts, ſo far, that ſhe got ſpeaking, during the time of them; and while ſhe was in the fits, fell a crying, that <hi>Katharine Campbel and Agnes Naſmith were cutting her ſide, and other parts of her Body;</hi> Which parts were in that time violently Tormented And when the fit was over ſhe ſtill averred, <hi>that she had ſeen the ſame Perſons doing the ſame things</hi> which ſhe complained of while under the fit (it being remarkable that in the intervals ſhe was ſtill as well and ſenſible as ever and would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve but that others preſent ſaw them at well as ſhe!

                  <hi>Pilat</hi> he made a ſhew of cleanſing himſelf of CHRISTS Blood, he waſh'd his Hands and declar'd himſelf Innocent; but for all his waſhing, he had a foul Heart; he would not loſs his Office for the ſaving of CHRISTS Life: He knew well enough that CHRIST was an innocent Perſon; but he preferred his Honour before CHRIST; Therefore to pleaſe the <hi>Jevvs,</hi> and to quench the ſtrugling in his Conſcience, he waſht his Hands, and then delivered CHRIST to be Crucified by them.</q> Thus ſhe continued for more then two Hours ſpace; reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this Rate, and exhorting her to Repent, quoting many places of Scripture thorow the Revelation and Evangeliſts. And when any offered to pull her Bible from her, ſhe uttered horrid Schreeks and Out-crys, ſaying, <hi>She would never part v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ith her Bible as long as she liv'd, she vvould keep it ſpight of all the Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we paſs from this, it will be needful to give the Reader advertiſement of ſome things. 1. That while ſhe call'd for her Bible and a Candle ſhe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard nor ſaw any of thoſe Perſons who were then actually and diſcernably preſenting he Room with her, and that <hi>Katharine Campbel</hi> to whom ſhe directed her ſpeech was not diſcernably preſent to any other Body but her ſelf. And that pinch ſhe got in her inſenſible fit, ſhe found and complain'd of the pain of it in that part afterward, but knew not how ſhe came by it, nor blamed any of her tormentors for it. 2. That theſe words ſet down as ſpoken by her, were the very ſame both for words and order as nearly as they could be gathered and remembred by the hearers, without any addition of their own. 3. That altho ſhe was a Girle of a pregnant Spirit above her age, and had much of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and withal had pretty good underſtanding, above what might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of one of her years, of the foundamental principles of Religion taught in the Catechiſms; yet we doubt not but in ſo ſtrong a Combat, the Lord did by His good Spirit graciouſly affoord her a more then ordinary meaſure of Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, both now and at other times in the like debates.</p>
            <p>Sometime after the putting out of her mouth the traſh above-mentioned ſhe fell into extreamly violent fits, with lamentable crying; four Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardly able to withhold her from Climbing up the Walls of the Chamber, or from otherwayes doing her ſelf hurt, mean time having no power of ſpeech, while in the fit, but her back and the reſt of her Body grievouſly pained: In which condition ſhe continued four of five days with the uſual ſenſible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals: In which ſhe declared, that four men <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>James Anderſons,</hi> and other two (of whom ſhe gave particular and exact marks, but knew not their names) were tormenting her. It was obſerv'd that many of theſe ſhe named were known to be Perſons of ill-f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me, as theſe two Perſons laſt nam'd were: It is alſo remarkable, that for ſome time ſhe knew not the name of the ſaid <hi>Alexander Anderſon,</hi> till one day he came a begging to the door of the houſe, where the Damſel was, whom ſhe ſeeing, immediatly cryed out, <hi>that vvas be vvhom she had ſeen among the Crevv.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this ſhe fell into other Fits, wherein ſhe ſaw the forenamed Perſons with ſome others, and heard and ſaw ſeveral things that paſt among them. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, ſhe ſometimes told when ſhe was to take the fits, how often ſhe would
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:35409:8"/>take them, (which fell out accordingly) with ſome diſcourſes that were among them relating to her ſelf and others.</p>
            <p>About the eight of <hi>December,</hi> being brought home again from <hi>Glaſgovv,</hi> and having had ſix or ſeven days reſpite from her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ts, ſhe afterwards fell into fright ful and terrifying fits: The occaſion whereof ſhe declar'd to be, her ſeeing the Devil in prodigious and horrid ſhapes, threatning to devour her, and then ſhe would fall dead and ſtiff with all the parts of her Body diſtended and ſtretcht out as a Corpſe without ſenſe or motion; which fits as they came ſuddenly on without her knowledge, ſo ſhe did as ſuddenly recover and grew perfectly well; and they uſually came on when ſhe eſſayed to pray. In which time alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fits took her more ſenſibly, ſhe knowing when they were a coming, how long they would continue, and when they would return: In which fits her eyes ſtrangely altered, and turned in her head in the admiration of Spectators, with a continual painful working about her heart, ſometimes her joynts were complicat and drawn together, and her fore head drawn forcibly about toward her ſhoulders; which fits ſhe took by firſt falling into a Swoon, and after her violent fits in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ntly recovered after the ſame manner. During this time the fits altered again as to their times of comming and continuance; in which ſhe ſometimes endeavoured to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>er own ſingers, or any thing elſe that came in her way, alſo when ſhe ſaw the Perſons before mentioned, one or two of them about her, pointing them out to the Perſons preſent with her, tho by them unſeen, and ſometime declaring that ſhe had hold of them by their Cloaths. Particularly. <hi>December,</hi> 17, She being in a fore fit ſhe cry'd out of ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were tormenting her; and being in the bed, graſped with her hands towards the foot of it, and cry'd out, that ſhe had got a grip of the ſleeves of one <hi>J. P's.</hi> Jerkin (or Jacker) which was, as ſhe ſaid, duddie, (that is rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or tattered) at the elbows: And in that very inſtant the Damſels Mother and Aunt heard the ſound of the rending or tearing of a Cloth, but ſaw or felt nothing, only found in each of the Damſels hands which were faſt cloſed when they got them opened, a bit of red Cloth, locking as torn off a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of which kind of Cloath there had been none in the Room at that time nor in the whole houſe nor near it, that any kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w of. Another particular ſhe told was, that there was ſuch an one among the Crew going to prick her Tongue, which thereupon was inſtantly pull'd back into her Throat, ſhe lying dumb for a conſiderable ſpace. Sometimes upon her recovery from her Fits ſhe told that ſhe heard ſeveral things ſpoken and communed among her afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but durſt not make them known; becauſe they threatned to Torment her after this, or the other mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, if ſhe ſhould make them known, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly when by her Mother or others ſhe was prevailed with to begin to tell them inſtantly the Torment fell out as was threatned. She told further that her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors appear'd to her uſually with Lights and ſtrange ſorts of Candles, which were frightful to her to look to.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhe continued till the firſt of <hi>January.</hi> 1697, not only in the fits fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd with ſome alterations, but fell likewayes by ſwooning into light <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>its, wherein ſhe continued for two or three hours together, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs, with very ſhort Intervals, in which Fits ſhe did not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of pain; but had a great palpitation in her breaſt, and ſometimes in other parts of her Body ſtrange and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Night following ſhe was ſuddenly carried away, as before, from her Parents and others who were about her, thorow the Chamber and Hall, and ſixteen large ſteps of a winding Stair up, toward the top of the Houſe! where ſhe met with Apparitions of ſtrange and unaccountable things, but was carried down again as ſhe thought in a ſhue or ſwing, aſſerting after her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Notice here firſt, that when ſome Fits of this kind were ready to ſeize her, ſhe ſometimes

            <p>
               <hi>January,</hi> 21. Her Fits altered again, after this manner, ſhe would fall in them with heavy Sighs and Groans and hideous Outeryes, telling thoſe about her that Cats, Ravens, Owles and Horſes were deſtroying and preſſing her down in the Bed: And at the ſame time her Mother and another Gentlewoman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Room with her, did declare that immediatly after they had taken the Girle out of her Bed in this condition, they did ſee ſomething moving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bed-cloaths as big as a Cat.</p>
            <p>The ſame Morning in the interval of her Fits, ſhe ſaid, ſhe heard her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors Whiſper amongſt themſelves, and ſuggeſt to one another, (naming <hi>J. P.</hi> the <hi>Anderſons</hi> and others) that the Devil had promiſed and engaged to them, to carry her over the Hall Window, to the end they might Drown her in the Well which was in the court; and then they ſaid the World would believe ſhe had deſtroyed her ſelf; and the ſame day and ſeveral dayes thereafter, when ſeiz'd with her Grievous Fits, did attempt with ſuch force to get her ſelf over that Window, that Spectators could ſcarce with their whole ſtrength prevent her.</p>
            <p>About this time, nothing in the World would ſo diſcompoſe her as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Exerciſes, if there were any diſcourſes of God or Chriſt, or any of the things which are not ſeen and are Eternal, ſhe would be caſt into grievous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies; and when ſhe aſſayed in her light Fits, to read any portion of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, repeat any of the Pſalms, or anſwer any Queſtions of out Catechiſms (which ſhe could do exactly well at other times) ſhe was ſuddenly ſtruck Dumb and lay as one ſtiff Dead, her Mouth opened to ſuch a Wideneſs that her Jaw appeard to be out of joynt, and anone would clap together again with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Force. The ſame happened to her Shoulder blade, her Elbow, and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wriſts. She would at other timely in a benum d Conditions, 2nd be drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as if ſhe had been ty'd Neck &amp; Heels with Ropes; yet on a ſudden would with ſuch Force and Violence be pull'd up and Tear all about her, that it was as much as one or two could do, to hold her faſt in their Arms: But when Miniſters and other good Chriſtians (ſeeing her in ſuch intollerable Anguiſhes) made ſerious Application by Prayer to God, on her behalf, ſhe got reſpite from her grievous Fits of this kind, and was ordinarly free of them during the time of Prayer, tho ſeiz'd of them before; and albeit uſually when Miniſters began to Pray ſhe made great diſturbance by idle lowd talking, Whiſtling, Singing, and Roating, to drown the Voice of the perſon praying. Particularly <hi>January</hi> 22. She was more Turbulent then at other times ſhe us'd to be, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome ſpace after the Miniſter began to Pray, Singing and making a hideons Noiſe, ferening furious Blows with her Fiſt, and Kicks with her Feet at the Miniſter, uttering reproachful Talk of him, and calling him Dog, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet ſhe being Compos'd, and her Fits being over before Prayer was ended, and the Miniſter when he had done, finding her Sober and a right Compoſure of Mind, enquired why ſhe made ſuch diſturbance? To which ſhe reply'd, ſhe was force to do it by the Helliſh Crue about her, and that ſhe thought they were none of her own words that ſhouttered.</p>

She ſaid ſome things relating both to herſelf and others had been inggeſted to her by her Troublers; but that they had threatned to Torment her, if the ſhould offer to make them known. And accordingly ſhe Eſſaying to expreſs her Mind, was caſt into two greivous Fits, in which ſhe cry'd out of
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:35409:11"/>violent pains; all the parts of her Body becoming Rigid and extended like a Corpſe, her Head was twiſted round, and if any offered by force to obſtruct ſuch dangerous Motion ſhe ſeem'd to be upon, ſhe would roar exceedingly ſo menmes her Nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> bone ſeem'd to be diſſolv'd; and yet on a ſudden became ſo ſtiff, that there was no moving of it; and when thoſe greivous Agonys were over, ſhe again Eſſay'd to expreſs her Mind by Write, but to no purpoſe; for inſtantly ſhe was caſt into other two very greivous Fits, wherein ſhe was ſtruct Dumb, Deaf and Blind, and her Tongue drawn a prodigeous length over her Chin. And when the Fits were over, declar'd, the <hi>Anderſons J. P.</hi> the Gentlewoman, and <hi>I. D.</hi> with the reſt of the Helliſh Crew, ſome of whom ſhe could no shame, had been Tormenting her in the Fits, and that there has been fifteen of them about the Houſe all the laſt Night; but were now all gone, ſave one, who was to ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> about the Houſe till her Fits were over. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly her Brother and Siſter did declare; they ſaw that Morning a Woman in the Garden with a red Good about her Head, ſitting at the Root of an Aple-Tree; but <hi>Bargarren</hi> with moſt of the Servants being abroad, the Matter was not further ſearch't.</p>
            <p>The ſame day about Six at Night, ſhe was ſeiz'd with variety of greivous Fits again, in which ſometimes ſhe lay wholly Senſeleſs and Breathleſs, with her Belly ſwer'd like a Drum, as like a Woman with Child, her Eyes were pul'd into her Head ſo far that Spectators thought ſhe ſhould never have us'd them more, ſometimes when ſhe was tying her own Neck-cloaths, her enchanted Hands would ty them ſo ſtrait about her Neck, that ſhe had ſtrangled her ſelf if Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators had not given ſome Relief unto her; ſometimes ſhe was in hazard of burning her ſelf in the fire, offering with violence to throw her ſelf into the ſame. Divers time ſhe did ſtrick furious Blows at her near Relations in her Fits, ſhe'd maintain Diſcource with her Tormentors; and asking Queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her ſelf and others, received anſwer from them; which indeed none but her ſelf perceiv'd: Reaſoning particularly with one of them after this manners; <q>O what ail'd thee to be a Witch! thou ſai'ſt it is but three Nights ſince thou waſt a Witch, O if thou would'ſt Repent, it may be GOD might give thee Repentance, if thou would'ſt ſeek it, and Confeſs; if thou would deſire me I would do what I could; for he Devil is an ill Maſter to ſerve, he is a Dyer from the beginning, he promiſes but he cannot perform. Then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for her bible, ſhe ſaid, I'l let thee ſee where he promiſed to our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that they ſhould not Die. <hi>And reading the paſſage, ſaid,</hi> now thou ſeeſt he is a Lyer; for by breaking of the Commandment, they were made lyable to Death here and Death everlaſting. O that's an Uncouth word; long Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity never to nave an end, never never to have an end: Had not GOD of his infinit Mercy ordain'd ſome to Eternal Life throught JESUS CHRIST. The Devil makes thee believe thou wilt get great Riches by ſerving him; but come near, </q> and having uttered this word ſhe loſt power of Speech, her Tongue being drawn back into her Throat; yet beckning with her Hand to the Spectre to come near her, &amp; turning over the Book, kep't her Eye upon that paſſage of Holy Scripture. <hi>Job.</hi> 27.18. And pointing with her Finger at the place' and ſhaking her Head; turn'd over the Book again. And recovering Speech' ſaid, <q>I'l let thee ſee where GOD bids us ſeek and we ſhall find, and reading over the place ſaid, it is GOD that gives us every good Gift, we have nothing of our own, I ſubmit to his will tho I never be better; for GOD can make all my trouble turn to my Advantage; according to his Word, </q>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. which
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:35409:12"/>place the then read, and thus continued Reaſoning, for the ſpace of an Hour.</p>
            <p>Sometimes ſhe cry'd out of violent pain, by reaſon of furious Blows and Stroaks ſhe had received from the Hands of her Tormentors, the Noiſe of which Stroaks by ſtanders diſtinctly heard, tho they perceiv'd not the Hands that gave them. One Night the Girle fitting with her Parents and others cry'd out. <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wounding her Thigh.</hi> Upon which, inſtantly her Mother puting her Hand in the Damſels pocket, found her folding Knife open'd, which had been folded, when put in her Pocket, but her Uncle not truſting the thing; did again put up the Knife and leaving it folden in her pock't on a ſudden ſhe cry'd out as before, <hi>the Knife was cutting her Thigh, being unfolded by the means of</hi> I. P. and <hi>others,</hi> as ſhe ſaid: Upon which her Uncle ſearching her Pocket, again found the Knife open'd as formerly. This happened twice or thrice to the Administation of the Beholders, tho they took ſpecial Notice that ſhe nor any other viſible Hand opened it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 25th. She was again ſeizd with her Swooning ſtiff Fits, with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Variation; her Throat was ſometimes moſt prodigiouſly extended, and ſometimes as ſtrangely Contracted and Convel'd, ſo that ſhe appeard in palpable danger of being Choak't, and through the violence of pain in her Throat and difficulty of Breathing ſtruggled with her Feet and Hands, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſome had been actually Strangling her, and could Speak or Cry none; with which kind of Fits ſhe was frequently ſeiz'd for ſeveral days; and in the intervals did declare that the fore-mention'd perſons, and other (whom ſhe could not get then nom'd) were ſtrangling her, and that the occaſion of her not having power to ſpeak or cry in the Fit, was a Ball in her Throat, which alſo was viſible to ſpectators; for they did clearly diſcern a Bunch in her Throat (while in the <hi>Fit</hi>) as bigg as a <hi>Pullets Egg</hi> which had almoſt Choak't her.</p>
            <p>Sometimes ſhe was kep't from eating her Meat; having her Teeth ſett, when ſhe carried any food to her Mouth. Diverſe times alſo ſhe was kept from Drinking, when at Meat; for no ſooner could ſhe taſte the Drink, but ſhe was in hazard to be Choak't thereby, and her ſelf ſometimes would have held the Cup ſo hard betwixt her Teeth, that it was not in the power of thoſe with her to unlooſe it. And when any thing had fallen out amiſs in the place where ſhe was, as the falling and breaking of a Cup, and Body's receiving harm, and ſuch like. She would fall a laughing and rejoyce extremely; which kind of Jollity was for from the Girl's temper when at her ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February 1ſt.</hi> She Eſſaying to tell ſome things ſhe had been forbidden by her Tormentors to make known, was handled with intolerable Torments. At the beginning of her Fits uſually ſhe would be kep't odly looking; ſometimes toward the Chimney, ſometimes towards other particular places in the Room, but could not always tell what ſhe ſaw; yet for ordinary ſhe'd Name ſuch and ſuch Perſons, who, ſhe ſaid were then come to caſt her into Fits. And when any deſired her to cry to the LORD JESUS for help, her Teech were inſtantly ſett cloſs, her Eyes tuiſted almoſt round in her Head, and ſhe was thrown upon the Floo with the ſtiffneſs, &amp; poſture of one that had been ſome days laid for Dead: And on a ſudden recovered again, and would weep bitterly, to remember what had befal'n her. The ſame day, when her Fits were over, ſhe ſaid, ſhe now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it was by the means of a Charm, that ſuch Reſtraints were laid upon her that ſhe could not tell what the Witches had forbidden her to make known, but the Charm might be found out (as ſhe ſaid) by ſearching for it beneath the Bed where ſhe lay; and ſhe having quickly done this her ſelf, found (to the
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:35409:12"/>apprehenſion of Spectators) beneath the foreſaid Bed, an inteir Egg-ſhell open in the end, which being in ſtantly thrown into the Fire, did melt away after the manner of Wax. without any ſuch Noiſe as Egg-ſhells uſe to make when burning in the Fire. After this the Girle ſaid, ſhe would not now be handled ſo ſeverely, upon Eſſaying to make known what the Witches had forbidden her to tell, only her Tongue would be drawn back into her Throat, which accordingly happened. She did like ways inform her Friends of many things ſhe had not liberty to do before the Charm was found out, particularly that her Tormentors had frequently ſolicited her to become a Witch her ſelf, and promiſed her great Riches, and perfect Health alſo, to induce her thereunto. Which Tentation, ſhe through the infinit Mercy of GOD ſtill reſiſted, reaſoning with them after this manner <q>The Devil promiſes what he cannot perform, and granting he could fulfill his promiſes; yet I am ſure from the Scriptures, Hell and the wrath of GOD will be the final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all ſuch as yeild to this Wickedneſs.</q> 
               <hi>To which the receiv'd this reply (which indeed none but her ſelf perceiv'd) that</hi>
               <q>Hell and the wratch of GOD ſo much talk't of, was not ſo formidable as was repreſented.</q> She alſo ſaid, the Witches had Importunately urged her to give them her Conſent, to take away the Life of her young Siſter, who was at that time upon her Mothers breaſt; which Tentation alſo ſhe was enabled thorow the Grace of God to reſiſt. She told her Parents likeways, there had been a Charm laid upon the top of the Houſe where her young Siſter was (the Child having been ſent out a nurſing, by reaſon of the continued Affliction of the Family) and that the Charm had been plac'd upon the top of the Houſe by <hi>pinch'd Maggi,</hi> who thereby did deſign the taking away of her Siſters Life; and that this was the Cauſe why ſhe had ſo often for ſome Weeks before deſired her Mother to bring home her Siſter, conſtantly affirming, that the Child would daily decay as long as ſhe ſtayed there: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon her Parents obſerving the daily decay of the Infant; even to Skin and Bone, brought her home, where ſhe recovered. And the Girle being asked how ſhe came to the knowledge of theſe things? Reply'd, ſome thing ſpeaking diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it were above her Head, had ſuggeſted theſe &amp; other things of that Nature to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February 2d.</hi> The Girle being in the Chamber with her Mother and others, was on a ſudden ſtruck with great Fear and Conſternation; and fell a trembling upon the ſight of <hi>John Lindſay</hi> in <hi>Barcloch,</hi> talking with her Father in the Hall. She ſaid to her Mother, the foreſaid <hi>Lindſay</hi> had been always one of her moſt violent Tormentors, and that ſhe had been threatned with extreme Tortures, if ſhe ſhould offer to Name him; whereupon ſhe was deſired to go toward the place where he was, and touch ſome part of his Body in a way unknown to him, which ſhe having done with ſome Averſation, was in ſtantly ſeiz'd with extreme Tortures in all the parts of her Body. After which <hi>Lindſay</hi> was put to it, and Interrogat thereupon; but he giving no ſatisfying Anſwer, was deſir'd to take the Damſel by the Hand, which he being unwillingly induc'd to do, ſhe was immediatly upon his Touch caſt into intolerable Anguiſhes, her Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt twiſted round in her Head, and all the parts of her Body becoming Rigid and ſtiff, fell down in the poſture of one that had been laid for ſome days Dead, and afterwards got up in a ſudden, and tearing her Cloaths, threw her ſelf with violence upon him, and when her Fits were over, Spectators did alſo take the Damſel by the Hand; yet no ſuch effect followed.</p>
            <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:35409:13"/>
            <p>About Six at Night there came an Old Highland fellow to <hi>Bargarran,</hi> who calling himſelf a wear traveller, ſaid he behoov'd to Lodge there that Night, but the Servants refuſing him Lodging, gave him ſomething be way of Alins. At this time the Damſel being in the Chamber with her Mother and another Gentle woman, ſaid to her beſt apprehenſion there was one of the wicked Crew in or about the Houſe at that time; whereupon her Mother made haft with her Daughter down flaars toward the Kitchen. And finding there unexpectedly the Highland fellow, whom the Girle then accuſed as one of her Tormentors, ſhe deſired the Highland fellow to take her Daughter by the Hand, which he being urg'd to do, the Girle immediatly upon his Touch was grievouſly Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the parts of her body And this falling out in divine providence, <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And when her Fits were over ſhe beſought the Highland fellow to allow her the Liberty for to diſcover and tell Perſons that Haunted and Moleſted her, whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden her to make known: Upon which the old Fellow looking at her with an angry Countenance, her Mouth was inſtantly ſtop't, and her Teeth ſett: But being deſired by thoſe preſent to ſpeak her mind freely; whether he would or not, at length reply'd, ſhe fear'd to do it. And when thorow the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Lairds of <hi>Dargavel</hi> and <hi>Porterfield</hi> of <hi>Fulwood,</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen there preſent, the Eſſay'd to declare her mind, ſhe was ſeiz'd with her Fits again.</p>
            <p>Before this time, the lamentable Caſe of the afflicted Damſel and Family had been repreſented to His Majeſty's moſt Honourable Privy Council, who, upon ſerious Application made to them, worthily and piouſly granted a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a Noble Lord and ſome worthy Gentlemen, to make enquiry into the ſame.

            <p>About this time, <hi>Thomas Lindſay</hi> a young Boy not yet Twelve Years of Age, was ſez'd, upon ſlagran; Preſumptions of Witchcraft; he had ſaid before ſeveral credible Perſons, the Devil was his Father, and if he pleas'd he could fly in the likeneſs or a Crow upon the Maſt of a Ship, he ſometimes caus'd a Flough ſtand

And when ſhe came out of the Church after the Fotenoon's Work, ſhe ſaid, the Devil was a Liar, for no ſuch thing fell out as he had threatned. She was all day very quiet in Church; altho being in ſome of her light Fits ſome Spectres appear'd in time of the publick Work, which ſhe told of thereafter.</p>
            <p>About ſix at Night there were preſent in the Chamber with the Damſel, Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> with his Wife, Lady <hi>Northbarr</hi> and others, diſcourſing and conferring about her Caſe; and while they were thus conferring together, ſhe told them, ſhe would gladly make ſome things known if ſhe durſt for her Tormenters;
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:35409:14"/>and afterwards eſſaying to do it, was inſtantly ſeiz'd with a violent Fit; in which ſhe leapt ſtraight up, and appear'd as if ſhe had been choak'd, ſo that it was as much as one or two could do, to hold her faſt in their Arms: And when the Fit was over, Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> going about Family Worſhip, did expound <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110. and ſpeaking of the limited power of the Adverſaries of our Lord JESVS CHRIST, from the latter part of Ver 1 ſhe was on a ſudden ſeiz'd with another grievous Fit, in which ſhe put out of her Mouth ſome Blood, which rais'd Grounds of Fear and Jealouſy in the Minds of Spectators, that ſomething in her Mouth hurting her had been the occaſion of it; yet they could not get her Mouth opened, tho they uſed means to open the ſame, her Teeth being cloſs ſet. And in the interval of the Fit ſhe being ask'd, if ſhe found any thing in her Mouth that had been the occaſion of her putting out of Blood; ſhe reply'd, ſhe found nothing, not knew the Cauſe thereof; but opening her mouth, thoſe preſent found one of her double Teeth newly drawn cut, but knew not what became of the Tooth; for tho' ſearch was made for the ſame, it could not be found: After which the Miniſter proceeded upon the ſame ſubject, but was again interrupted by her renewed Fit, yet cloſed the Exerciſe with Prayer, after which, without more trouble, ſhe was taken to her Bed.</p>

               <hi>February</hi> 12. <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> and her Daughter <hi>Martha Semple,</hi> being delated by the three Confeſſants, and accuſed by the Girl to have been active Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in her Trouble, came of their own accord to <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Houſe, and before they came up Stairs the Girl ſaid, ſhe was now bound up, and could not accuſe <hi>Margaret Laing</hi> to her Face: And accordingly the Giri's Mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſired ſome of thoſe who were ſitting by her to feel ſome parts of her Body, and they having done it, found her Body ſo ſtiff and inflexible, that there was no moving of it, and immediatly again found ſome parts of her Body contracted and drawn hard togethe, as if by Cords; after this <hi>Margaret Lang</hi> and her Daughter, having gone to the Chamber to the Girle, did in preſence of the Miniſters and others, deſire the Damſel to come to her; for ſhe would do her no Harm, and laying her Arms about her, ſpake very faiſly to her, and queſtion'd her if ever ſhe had ſeen her or her Daughter amongſt her Tormentors, to which the Girle did poſitively reply, ſhe had frequently ſeen her Daughter; but declined thorow fear to accuſe her ſelf, ſaying faintly <hi>No;</hi> after which <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> and her Daughter returning into the Hall, and the Miniſter enquiring at her why ſhe ſaid <hi>No,</hi> ſeeing ſhe had accus'd her before, ſhe anſwered, take me contrar, upon which ſhe was ſeiz'd with a grievous fit; yet after her recovery being urg'd again by thoſe preſent to tell her Mind freely, whether or not <hi>Margaret Lang</hi> was one of her Tormentors the Child thereupon Eſſaying to ſay <hi>Yes,</hi> and having half pronounced the Word, was caſt into unexpreſſible Anguiſhes; and again in the interval of the Fit, ſhe Eſſay'd to expreſs the ſame thing, and ſaying only the word <hi>Tint</hi> (that is loſt) was on a ſudden ſtruck with another fit, and when the fit was over, and the Child returned to the Chamber, <hi>Margaret Lang</hi> who was ſitting near the Hall door, ſpoke theſe words after her. <hi>The Lord bleſsthee, and ding (that is beat, or drive) t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And its remarkable, that it could be atteſted that there was no Hair, or any other thing elſe in that place before <hi>Margaret Lang</hi> came in, and the Girle being enquired, what way ſhe knew <hi>Margaret Lang</hi> had laid the forementioned Charm upon her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, ſomething ſpeaking diſtinctly to her as it were above her Head, had ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that to her.</p>
            <p>About Eight at Night ſhe was ſeverely handled in her Fits, much after the former manner, and while ſhe was in her ſwooning Fits, there was ſeen in her Mouth a Pin, where with ſhe ſeem'd almoſt Choak't; but by divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it was with great difficulty got out. After this ſhe was ſomewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and did not much complain of pain; but was diſtinctly heard to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſcourſe with ſome inviſible Creatures about her, and the Reply's given by her, and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> thereafter being <hi>February</hi> 25 She continued in the former fits, weeping bitterly and complaining of pain in both her ſides, ſhe alſo told in the interval of her fits, that ſhe was that night to be in very grievous and ſore fits, her tormenters being reſolved to choak her, by putting pins in her mouth, which (tho ſhe emptied her ſelf of all that were in her Cloaths) yet accordingly came to paſs: In which ſhe was both Blind and Deaf, leaping up and down in an extraordinary manner, pulling down vvhat ever came to her Hand, and this continued for ſome days putting out of her Mouth a great quantity of ſmall broken Pins, vvhich ſhe declar'd <hi>J.

After this, ſhe put out of her Mouth a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pin, by which ſhe told the fore ſaid Highland fellow having forc't it into her Mouth, deſign'd to Choak her.</p>
            <p>The firſt eight days of <hi>March</hi> ſhe continued in her former fits; with little Variation, putting out of her Mouth a great number of ſmall Pins, often faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and falling as Dead upon the ground on a ſudden, again ſtrugling with Feet and Hands; by all which her Natural Spirits were much Weakned and Exhauſted; ſometimes alſo she Eſſay'd to go into the Fire. About this time when Miniſters and other Chriſtians met in the Family for Prayer, ſhe us'd at the beginning of the work to make great diſturbance, particularly <hi>March</hi> 2. which day being ſet a part for Faſting and Praying in the Family, prayer begun, ſhe was for ſome time very compoſed, untill of a ſudden, a ſtrong blaſt of Wind forced open the Windows of the Room; upon which ſhe was inſtantly ſeiz'd with a violent fit, the Miniſter in the very ſame time ſupplicating GOD that ſhe might be delivered from Satans Bonds: In which fit ſhe being both Blind and Deaf as to All, except her Tormentors, was hurried with violence to and fro the Room, ſometimes falling down as one Dead, ſometimes Singing and making a Hidious loud Noiſe, ſomtimes nameing <hi>M. M.</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who ſhe ſaid, were there preſent Afflicting and Tormenting her, withall, nameing the particular places of the Room where ſhe, ſaw them ſtanding and ſitting. After all which, when recorered out of the fit, ſhe told that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:35409:17"/>woman and a little Highland fellow came in with the blaſt of Wind, which forc'd open the Windows. This falling out upon the <hi>Tueſday,</hi> ſhe continued in the light fit without any Intermiſſion, till the Sabbath thereafter, not being ſeiz'd with any of her ſore fits: And having gone to Church the Lords day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, was perfectly well for the moſt part of the day; yet affirmed ſhe ſaw <hi>Janet Wagh</hi> and others in one of the Windows of the Church, tho inviſible to all others.</p>

               <hi>Tueſday,</hi> being <hi>March</hi> the 9th. Her Mother and <hi>Margaret Campbel</hi> her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin took the Damſel to walk with them in the Orthard; and returning back to the houſe, her Mother entring the Tower gate firſt, the Damſel being at her back and <hi>Margaret Campbel</hi> tarrying a little while at the gate; her Mother going into the Kitchen, ſuppos'd they had both been with her, whereas the Damſel was of a ſudden carried away in a flight up Stairs with ſo ſwiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

P.</hi> had carried her away from her Mothers back as ſhe entred the Kitchen door (her feet not touching the ground to her apprehenſion) and that with a deſign to ſtrangle her in an high wardrob with Ropes on which the Linning us'd to dry, but that the ſaid J. <hi>P.</hi> could carry her no further then the place where ſhe was found, and did therefore leave her in ſuch a Violent fir,</p>
            <p>Upon the Lords day thereafter being <hi>March</hi> 14. Her fits again altered, in that her Mouth and Noſe were prodigiouſly diſtorted and turned about while in the fit, herface being thereby ſtrangely and horridly deform'd. That ſame day ſhe being in Church in the Forenoon, her Glove falling from her, the ſame was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain put into her Hand by ſome inviſible Agent, to the Amazment of beholders. To which we may add here, as that which is worthy of remark, that all this while an <hi>Inviſible beeing,</hi> haunted her on all occaſions, ſuggeſting many things unto her, both concerning her ſelf and others; but yet never heard by any but her ſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſame day betwixt Sermons, ſhe told that ſhe was to be violently Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the Afternoon; which accordingly came to paſs, and when in her fits ſhe named one <hi>J. K.</hi> a Woman living in the Nighbouring bounds of whom ſhe ſaid, that ſhe had ſeen her in the Church. As alſo, that ſhe was Maſter of theſe kind of fits ſhe was now afflicted with; withal aſſerting, that if the ſaid <hi>I. K.</hi> were not ſent for, ſhe would grow worſe and worſe; which her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents finding to be true, ſent in the Evening for the ſaid. <hi>I. K</hi> threatning her, if the Damſel was any further troubled with her, that ſhe ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended as others had been; after which the Damſel being in the mean time in a very ſore fit, the forementioned <hi>I. K.</hi> prayed (tho not deſired) that GOD might ſend the Damſel her Health; whereupon the Damſel was no more troubled with theſe kind or fits; but did inſtantly recover, by failing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſwoon as ſhe us'd to do before recovery out of any of her fits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> being <hi>March</hi> 16, ſhe was again ſeiz'd with her other kind of fits, all the parts of her body being Stiff and Rigid; and ſometimes in them was hear'd converſing with the Gentlewoman (as ſhe call'd her) vindicating her ſelf of what the Gentlewoman alledged againſt her, <hi>Viz. That she had accuſed ſome innocent perſons as her Tormenters.</hi> To which the Damſel diſtinctly Reply'd, <hi>That
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:35409:17"/>she was a Lyer, ſaying, it was you your ſelf, and none other ever mentioned any ſuch thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſhe continued untill the <hi>Friday</hi> thereafter, being never free of the light fits, now and then alſo falling into ſwoons, and appear'd to be almoſt choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the means of ſome Charms and Inchantments, inviſibly conveyed into her Mouth; which to the apprehenſion of Spectators, were as if it had been pieces of Chaſtnuts, Orange-pills, Whites of Eggs, or ſuch like, all which were diſtinctly obſerved, when occaſionally in the fit ſhe opened her Mouth; and when Spectators Eſſay'd to get them out, ſhe kep't her Mouth &amp; Teeth ſo cloſs, that no ſtrength could open the ſame. And when recovered out of the fit, ſhe told <hi>L. M.</hi> a Woman living in the Neighbouring bounds had put them in her Mouth.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Friday</hi> being <hi>March</hi> 19. She was violently Tormented with ſore fits, in which her Neck was diſtorted, and bended back like a Bow towards her Heels, ſtrugling with Feet and Hands, ſometimes Stiff, Blind, and Deaf, putting out of her Mouth a great number of ſmall Pins; which ſhe ſaid the forementioned <hi>L. M.</hi> had put in her Mouth. And about ſix a Clock that ſame Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violently Tormented, fell a crying, <hi>That if the Gentlewoman was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that Night, it would be in vain to apprehend her to morrow:</hi> For, ſaid ſhe, <hi>I have much to ſuffer at her Hands betwixt Twelve and One a Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> After this the Damſel lifting up her Eye lids with her Hands, and looking upwards, ſaid, <hi>what art thou that tells me that the Sheriff and my Father are coming here this Night?</hi> After which the Sheriff, her Father and <hi>James Guthry</hi> Meacer to the Juſticiary Court inſtantly come up ſtairs, to the Amazment of thoſe who remembered what the Damſel juſt now had ſaid. The Damſel continuing all this while Blind and Deaf; yet was heard (the foreſaid perſons being preſent) diſtinctly to diſcourſe with ſome in viſible Beeing near to her, ſaying, <hi>Is the Sheriff come, is he near me?</hi> and ſtreaching out her hand to feel if any were about her, the Sheriff put his hand in her's; notwithſtanding of which, ſhe ſaid to the inviſible Beeing diſcourſing with her, I <hi>cannot feel the Sheriff, how can he be preſent here? or how can I have him by the hand as thou ſay'ſt, ſeeing</hi> I <hi>feel it not? Thou ſay'ſt he hath brown coloured Cloths, red plush Breeches with black ſtrips, flovvred</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Muſting Cravat, and an imbroidered Sword Belt: Thou ſays there is an Old gray Hair'd Man with him, having a Ring upon his Hand; but I can neither ſee nor feel any of them? what are they come to apprehend the GentleWoman? Is this their Erand indeed?</q> And the Gitle being enquired how ſhe came to the knowledge of theſe ſtrange things? Reply'd as formerly in the like caſe, ſomething ſpeaking diſtinctly as above her Head, ſuggeſted them to her. It is very obſerveable here, that the foreſaid perſons had that ſame After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon got an order from the Commiſſioners of Juſticiaty to apprehend the ſame Gentlewoman, and were ſo far on their way to put it to Execution againſt the next Morning; but being witneſſes to the Damſels trouble, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſhe had told, to wit: That a delay in that matter would prove to her exceeding dangerous, they went ſtraight on in their Journey that ſame Night to the Gentlewomans Habitation, and put their warrand to Execution.</p>
            <p>As the Damſel ſtill continued to be violently Tormented, ſometimes lying with her Neck and other parts of her Body upon the Ground; as if they had been disjoynted, ſometimes alſo Eſſaying to throw her ſelf into the Fire. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ten a Clock the ſame Night ſhe continuing in the Fit, her Father (who had not gone with the Sheriff) beginning to read a part of the Word of GOD, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:35409:18"/>the Words after him tho Blind and Deaf in the mean time, which made Spectators apprehend, that the Damſel had the ſenſe of Hearing in theſe ſorts of fits, at leaſt when the Word of GOD was read: To find out the truth of which, her Father did ceaſe from reading, which tho he did; yet the Damſel continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repeat the following Verſes of the Chapter, while none in the Room were reading, and ſhe her ſelf had no Book: withal being heard ſay to ſome inviſible Beeing about her, <hi>Wilt thou teach me a part of the Old Teſtament as vvell as the Nevv.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Damſel ſtill continuing in the fore mentioned Fits, ſaid unto the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preſent, that now it was Twelve of the Clock; Oh it is now paſt Twelve, ſometimes lying as one dead thorow the violence of pain and decay of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits, ſometimes again recovering, eſſay'd to expreſs ſomewhat, but could not; withal putting out of her Mouth a great quantity of crooked Pins, and the parts of her Body being prodigiouſly diſtorted, ſhe complain'd of great pain: Thus ſhe continued until half an hour after Twelve a Clock at Night; when on a ſudden ſhe recovered, to the admiration of Beholders, telling them, <hi>She might novv go to Bed,</hi> being told by ſome inviſible Informer, that the Sheriff and the other Gentleman, to wit the Macer, had now entred the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Houſe; and accordingly going to bed, was no further troubled that Night. It is worthy of remark here, that the Sheriff and Macer at their return did declare, that it was juſt about that time they entred the Gentlewomans Houſe, which the Damſel condeſcended upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> being <hi>March</hi> 20- About Ten a Clock in the Forenoon ſhe was of a ſudden ſeiz'd with fits falling down as dead, her eyes quite cloſed, ſometimes again opening and turning in her head, ſhe ſaw nor heard none about her, but was hurried with violence to and fro thorow the Room, crying with a loud voice when any by force would hinder her motion. She being in this poſture and depriv'd thus of her ſenſes, <hi>James Lindſay</hi> one of the three Confeſſants was brought into the Room, who no ſooner entered the door but was perceived by her, and ſhe ſmiling ran towards him, ſaying <hi>Jamie</hi> where haſt thou been this long time; how is it with thee? And anſwered him diſtinctly to every word he ſpake, tho at the ſame time ſhe neither heard nor ſaw any other in the Room, nor could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them albeit tryed by ſeveral experiments for that purpoſe, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Tobacco Box being held before her Eyes by a perſon preſent in the Room, ſhe did not ſee it, but as ſoon as it was put in the hand of <hi>James Lindſay</hi> ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly enquired at him, "Where he had got that Box; ſhe continuing in this poſture, the Sheriff, her Father being preſent, thought it fit to confront M. <hi>M.</hi> who was now come, thereby to try if the Damſel would hear or ſee her as ſhe had done <hi>James Landsſay,</hi> which accordingly they did. And as ſoon as M. M. entered the door the Damſel (tho ſtill in the fit) preſently ſmiled and ſaid, I ſee the Gentlewoman now, tho formerly she had never ſeen her perſonally but only her ſpectre in the fits. She likewiſe heard her when ſhe ſpoke to her anſwering diſtinctly ſome queſtions propoſed by M. M, ſuch as, When it was ſhe had ſeen her tormenting her. To which ſhe anſwered, ſhe had ſeen her the other night in her fits, and further challenged her, Why ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd her from making known the Highland Wifes name, as alſo ſaying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, Thou pretends thou knoweſt not what I ſay, thou knoweſt well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Upon all which; the Gentlewoman on a ſudden (without being deſired) prayed, That the Lord might ſend the Damſel her health ſaying, "Lord help thee poor daft Child and rebuke the Devil. Which words were no ſooner ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered then the Damſel fell down as dead, and being in this poſture carried to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:35409:18"/>Room inſtantly recovered of the Blind, Deaf, and alſo of the light fit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeing perfectly well &amp; continued ſo for ſometime, &amp; being thus recovered and M. M. removed into another Room, the Damſel was enquired at whom ſhe had ſeen in her laſt fit. To which ſhe reply'd, ſhe had ſeen the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, tho in the mean time ſhe was altogether ignorant of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans ever being perſonally preſent in the Room with her.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the Commiſsioners of Juſticiary having come to <hi>Bargarran.</hi> M. M. and the Damſel were again confronted, upon which the Damſel (being in the light Fit) upon the firſt look of the forementioned M. M, was ſuddenly ſeiz'd with ſore Fits, out of which when recovered, ſhe accuſed her as being one of her moſt violent tormenters, particularly mentioning ſuch and ſuch times in which ſhe had in an extraordinary manner afflicted her, as alſo what words ſhe ſpoke in her hearing while in the Fit, and which is yet more remarkable, did queſtion the Gentlewoman if ſhe did not ſometime in <hi>December</hi> laſt when ſhe was tormenting her, remember how ſhe went away from her in great haſte, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe could ſtay no longer being obliged to attend a Childs burial at home.

            <p>The Lords day following being <hi>March</hi> 21, ſhe fell into Swooning Fits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of no pain, except near to her heart, falling down as dead not only when the Fits ſeiz'd her, but alſo when ſhe recovered, ſometimes Singing after an unuſual manner, withall informing Spectators that <hi>J.

And at this time when either the herſelf, or thoſe about her, offered to read any part of Scripture, ſhe was violently.

            <p>As to this Conference there are ſeveral things exceeding remarkable, as firſt, that the Damſel upon her Anſwering, <hi>Yes,</hi> was immediatly ſeiz'd with a Fit. <hi>2dly.</hi> That however after <hi>Katharine Campbel</hi> had touch'd the Damſel in preſence of the Commiſſioners, upon the 5th, of <hi>February</hi> laſt, ſhe had ever ſince that time freedom to touch any of her Tormentors without being ſeiz'd with her Fits, as has been hinted, yet true it is, that in the room of that Charm a new one took place, <hi>viz.</hi> When any time ſhe looked upon her Tormentors in the Face, at the very firſt look ſhe was ſeiz'd with her Fits; which Charm ſhe declar'd was laid by the means of the forementioned <hi>L.

M.</hi> in the Face without being ſeiz'd with Fits, which for a conſiderable time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could not do when confronted with any of her Tormentors <hi>3ly,</hi> It is yet more obſervable, that in the ſame Morning before ever <hi>L.

About a Month thereafter, her Grand-mother and ſhe being in the Houſe together, the ſaid Gentleman (whom ſhe then ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be the Devil) appeared to them, and fell a talking with her Grand-mother, by rounding in one anothers Ears: Upon which the Grand-mother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to take him by the hand, being a friend of hers; but <hi>Elizabeth</hi> refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Grand-mother threatened, that ſhe would get none of the Cloaths promiſed to her, unleſs ſhe ſhould obey: Yet <hi>Elizabeth</hi> withſtood, ſaying, <hi>The Lord be between me &amp; him;</hi> whereupon he went away in a flight, but ſhe knew not how. <hi>Elizabath</hi> was not trouble for a long time thereafter, till her Father deſiring her to go with him a Begging through the Countrey; and ſhe ſaying, that ſhe needed not ſeek her Meat, ſeeing ſhe might have Work; her Father preſſed her to go alongſt, and took her to a Moor in <hi>Kilmacome,</hi> where were gathered together, at that and other ſubſequent Meetings, <hi>Katharine Campbel, Margaret Fulton</hi> (her Grand Aunt) <hi>Margaret Lang, John Reid</hi> Smith, <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> and <hi>Janet Rodgers,</hi> the three <hi>Lindſays</hi> (beſide the two Confeſſant ones) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſeverals whom ſhe did not know, and the foreſaid Gentleman with them.

At the ſecond appearance he gave him a Bite or Nipp in his Loyn; which he found painfull for a Fortnight. That the third time he appeared to him as a Black Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Deſired him to engage in his Service upon aſſurance of getting Gear and Comfort in the World; ſince he ſhould not want any thing that he would ask in the Devils Name: And then he renounced his Baptiſm, putting the one Hand to the Crown of his Head, and the other to the Sole of his Foot; thereby giving himſelf up to Sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns Service: After which the pain of the Bite or Nipp ceaſed. He told that hitherto there was none others preſent; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he was at ſeveral Meetings, particularly that in <hi>Bargarrans</hi> Yeard, about the time when there was a Faſt for <hi>Chriſtian Shaw,</hi> where the Devil appeared in the ſame kind of Garb as he firſt appeared to him, and they conſulted <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Death either by Worrieing or Drowning her in the Well; and the Devil ſaid, he ſhould warrand them, that they ſhould neither be Heard, Seen, nor Confeſs, to which end he gave every one of them a bitt of Fleſh, that the Declarant got, but let it fall, and did not Eat it. Thereafter in preſence of the Laird of <hi>Jordan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill</hi> the Miniſter, <hi>Mr. Andrevv Cochran</hi> town Clerk, and Baillie <hi>Paterſon,</hi> he owned his former Confeſſions: And being enquired of <hi>Jordanhill</hi> how they were advertiſed of their Meetings, he ſaid that ordinarly at their Meetings the time of the next was appointed; but for particular warning there appeared a Black Dog with a Chain about his Neck, who tinkling it, they were to follow &amp;c. And being enquired by the Miniſter if he did now wholly renounce the Devil (for he had formerly told how Satan had not performed his promiſe) and give himſelf to JESUS CHRIST, and deſire to find mercy of God through Him: he aſſented thereunto. It is to be obſerved that <hi>John Reid</hi> after his Confeſsion had called out of the priſon Window, deſireing Baillie <hi>Scott</hi> to keep that old Body <hi>Angus Forreſter,</hi> who had been his fellow priſoner, cloſs and ſecure; whereupon the company asked <hi>John</hi> when they were leaving him on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> night the 21 of <hi>May,</hi> whether he deſired company or would be afraid alone, he ſaid he had no fear of any thing: So being left till Saturdays Forenoon, he was found in this poſture. <hi>Viz.</hi> ſitting upon a ſtool which was on the Hearth of the Chimney, with his feet on the floor and his Body ſtraight upward, his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders touching the lin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are two remarkable inſtances in the Caſe of <hi>Katharine Campbel,</hi> who was chief Inſtrument and Author of the Girles trouble. <hi>Viz.</hi> An Eminent Miniſter diſcourſing before famous Witneſſes to <hi>Katharine,</hi> and enquiring if ſhe did not diſtinctly remember the Godly Counſels, and gracious Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which <hi>Chriſtian Shaw</hi> while in a fit mentioned in the Narrative, <hi>Page,</hi> 13. gave her at a certain time, and inſtancing ſome particular thereof: Her anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer was with heavy Groans, <hi>Yes I Remember.</hi> But being urged wherefore ſhe would not Confeſs the reſt as well as that paſſage; and finding herſelf thereby to be <hi>Gravelled:</hi> She began to Retract and ſeemed Dampt, not being able to Extricat her Anſwer before mentioned. This occurred while ſhe was in priſon, before the tryal: And after it, ſhe in preſence of ſeveral Witneſſes, did get out theſe words, <hi>That the Doom pronounced on her was moſt juſt,</hi> and that <hi>she could not free her ſelf of Witchcraft:</hi> But upon ſuch attempts ſhe fell down Dead, ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtended, and that ſix or ſeven times Succeſſivly, with a Suddeneſs, that was both Surpriſing &amp; Convincing to the Spectators: At which occaſion it was obſerved, that immediatly before her falling into theſe fits; and upon her Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying to ſpeak when there were Charges laid Home on her <hi>Natural Conſcience;</hi> her Mouth ſeemed to <hi>Contract<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>There is one thing further; which does aſtruct the Credibility of what theſe Confeſſants averred, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are ſome others, both Men and Women in the Countrey, who have confeſſed and told the ſame things before ſome of the beſt Gentry and others, whoſe Care could proceed no further for want of <hi>Authority,</hi> which in due time will, no doubt, <hi>not ſuffer theſe Witches to live,</hi>

            <head>An Account of TWO LETTERS Which contain a SUMMARY Of what appeared moſt MATERIAL or CURIOUS In the Trial of the SEVEN WITCHES Who were Condemn'd to be Execute in the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Truth of the ſtrange Things mentioned in the preceeding Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive was at firſt, carefully ſearched into only by <hi>private Perſons:</hi> But at laſt became ſo <hi>nottour,</hi> that, upon Application founded on a <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> of theſe extraordinary Events, atteſted by many of the Gentry in the Country; the Council gave a Commiſſion for <hi>enquiring</hi> thereanent.</p>
            <p>The Honourable Perſons to whom this was recommended, did, with great Impartiality and Exactneſs, make a <hi>Report:</hi> which, in <hi>Providence,</hi> proved a <hi>Mean</hi> of moving the Government to notice the Execution of Juſtice on ſome of theſe Witches, who otherways, might have lurked without being diſcoverered.</p>
            <p>For, hereupon, the Council directed a ſecond Commiſſion, for <hi>Trial</hi> of thoſe who appeared to them to be moſt loaded by the preliminary Probation addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the firſt. Several of theſe Judges were not only perſons of <hi>Honour,</hi> but alſo of <hi>ſingular Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Experience:</hi> Conform whereunto they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with <hi>ſingular Caution,</hi> and were ſo far from Precipitancy in the Affair, that, after <hi>ſeveral Diets</hi> of Court, they adjourned to a <hi>long Term,</hi> that, in the mean time, the Priſoners might be provided of Advocates.</p>
            <p>Accordingly an Advocate compeared for them, and managed their Defence with all the Accuracy that could be expected. There were above <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hours</hi> imploied, at <hi>one</hi> Diet, in Examination of Witneſſes: And the Inqueſt being încloſed, did conſume about <hi>ſix Hours</hi> in comparing the Probation-Whereupon Seven of the moſt notorious Criminals were Convict and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
            <p>The Crimes libelled and found proven againſt them, were not meer <hi>ſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Imaginations;</hi> but open and obvious <hi>Facts: viz.</hi> The <hi>Murders</hi> of ſome Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Perſons of Age; and the <hi>Torturing</hi> of ſeveral Perſons, particularly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35409:26"/>
               <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Daughter: And <hi>both</hi> theſe, not at a <hi>diſtances,</hi> but <hi>contignouſly</hi> by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Means</hi> of Cords, Pins, and the like. <hi>Beſides</hi> the other <hi>ordinary Works</hi> of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, ſuch as Reouncing <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> entering in <hi>Contract</hi> with, and <hi>Adoring</hi> the Devil under a Corporeal ſhape, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which could not but be ſuſtained Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince there is an expreſs Stature <hi>Parl.</hi> 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 73: <hi>Queen</hi> Mary, appointing the pain of Death to ſuch.</p>
            <p>To make the Probation the more convincing, it was adduced orderly in <hi>three Periods</hi> The Firſt conſiſted of <hi>unſuſpected Witneſses,</hi> who proved <hi>Fact:</hi> From whence it was neceſſarly inferred, That there was <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in the Caſe. The Second did include, <hi>alſo unexceptionable</hi> Witneſſes, who deponed upon <hi>Facts;</hi> which made it <hi>probable,</hi> if not neceſſary, that the Pannals were <hi>the Witches.</hi> The Third did comprehend <hi>ſix poſitive</hi> Teſtimonies, of theſe who did <hi>See</hi> and <hi>Hear</hi> theſe Witches committing the Malefices libelled.</p>
            <p>The only valuable Subject of Debate, was anent the Import of theſe <hi>laſt</hi> Teſtimonies; five whereof were by <hi>Confeſſants,</hi> who had been at the Meetings in which were committed the Crimes libelled; and the ſixth of <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Daughter, who was one of the Perſons maleficiat. The <hi>antecedent part</hi> of the Probation was by Witneſſes beyond exception: And the Judges upon a long Debate did ſuſtain Four of theſe Six <hi>only cum nota,</hi> and two of them to be Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <hi>without Oath.</hi> So nice were they in favours of the Pannals Lives, ſince ſome of theſe Witneſſes might have been admitted in ſuch a Crime without any <hi>quality,</hi> by the moſt ſcroupulous Judicatory in <hi>Europe.</hi> But all things were carried on in this Procedures with Tenderneſſ and Moderation: For even the <hi>Advocates.</hi> who were ſent to proſecute the Endytment by His Majeſty's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and Advocate, did not act with the Byaſs of <hi>Parties;</hi> but on the contrary, ſhowed an <hi>equal Concern</hi> to have the Pannals aſſoilaied, if it could be found compatible with Juſtilse</p>
            <p>This is the Reaſon for which the Publiſher doubts not, but the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters (the one whereof gives a Compend of the Advocates Speech to the Jury, and the other, of their Anſwers to the Objections againſt the Confeſſant Witneſſes) will afford a ſatisfying view of the chiefeſt part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Trial: ſince the Objections which were, or might have been made are therein Stated and Anſwered, or Anticipat and <hi>Prevented;</hi> and the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Brevity would not permit to printet this time the whole Proceſs, which being extant upon Record, any who are Curious may have eaſy acceſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>There is ſcarcely need to take notice of a late Scurrilous Pamphlet, that has been printed in <hi>England,</hi> and pretends to give an account of thoſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: For any who reads it may eaſily find, that the Author has been either. <hi>Fool, Know,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> there being neither good <hi>Language, Senſe,</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> in the moſt part of it.</p>

                  <p>YOU having ſitten above Twenty Hours in over hearing the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And being now to be incloſed, where, it's like, you will take no ſmall time to Re-conſider and Compare it: We ſhall not detain you with ſumming up the ſame in <hi>particular;</hi> but ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſt ſome Things, whereof it is fit you take ſpecial notice in your peruſal of it: <hi>viz. 1mo</hi> The <hi>Nature of your own Power,</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement</hi> thereof: <hi>2do.</hi> The <hi>Object</hi> of this Power which lies before you; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you are to conſider, in the Firſt place, Whether or not there has been <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> in the Malefices libelled?

                  <p>As to your Power, it is certain, that you are both <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> by the Opinion of our Lawyers and Cuſtom: Therefore you are called out of the <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> as preſumed beſt to know the Quality of the Pannals, and the Notority of their Guilt or Innocence. Your Oath is, That you ſhall all Truth tell, and <hi>no Truth conceal;</hi> which does plainly imply, That you are to Condemn or Aſſoilzie, conform to your proper Conviction. Such is the excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Juries in <hi>England:</hi> and ought to hold more ſpecially in this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiat Caſe, where there is ſuch a <hi>Chain</hi> of different Kinds of Probation concurring againſt the ſame Pannals, as will appear by the Review thereof in its proper place</p>

                  <p>As to the <hi>Probation it ſelf;</hi> you ſee, that it is divided in Three Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>extraordinarineſs</hi> of the Malefices: The <hi>Probability of the</hi> concurring <hi>Adminicles:</hi> And the Clearneſs of the <hi>poſitive Probation.</hi>

                  <p>As to the Firſt part, The Malefices, or <hi>Corpora delicti,</hi> are proven by <hi>unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Witneſſes,</hi> to have fallen out in ſuch an odd and <hi>extraordinary manner,</hi> that

                  <p>For clearing of this, particulatly in relation to the Torments of <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Daughter, you may conſider not only the extraordinary Things that could not proceed from a Natural Diſeaſe, which ly proven before you; but alſo ſeveral other Matters of Fact, which is <hi>nottour;</hi> have been ſeen by ſome of your ſelves, and ly here in a Journal of her Sufferings: Every Article whereof is atteſted by the Subſcriptions of Perſons of entire Credit, before the honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners appointed by His Majeſty's Privy Council, for making Enquiry there-anent</p>
                  <p>This Girl's throwing out of Hair, Pins, and Coals of <hi>greater heat</hi> than that of her Body or Blood; as alſo ſo <hi>dry,</hi> that they appeared not to have come out of her Stomack; nor had ſhe any <hi>preſs</hi> of Vomiting at the time, that ſhe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame to have been put in her Mouth by her Tormenters: Is deponed by Doctor <hi>Brisban,</hi> in his Opinion not to proceed from a Natural Caule.</p>
                  <p>She was not Tormented by any of the Pannals after their <hi>Impriſonment:</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two Nights by <hi>Katharine Campbell;</hi> which being a Surpriſe, it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after diſcovered, that theſe two Nights the Jaylor's Wife had got out <hi>Katharine Campbell</hi> to Spin in her Houſe.</p>
                  <p>She having been ſpeaking to one of her Tormenters as preſent (tho' Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the By-ſtanders) and asking how her Tormenter had got theſe clouted Red Sleeves; ſhe ſuddenly gets up, takes hold of them, the Company hear a ſhreid, and ſhe pulls away two pieces of red Cloth, which all the By-ſtanders beheld with amazement in her Hands: Nor was there any other peice of this kind of Cloth to be found in the Room at that occaſion.</p>
                  <p>She told, that her Tormenters were giving her a Glaſs of Sack, an Orange-pile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (thereby enſnaring her to accept of a Favour from them) and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſhe was ſeen to <hi>move</hi> her Lips, and to have the Orange-pile betwixt <hi>her Teeth;</hi> tho' there was no viſible Hand that could have done it.</p>
                  <p>She advertiſed before hand, that one of her Tormenters was to be at the Door at a particular Hour: And that another of them was in the Kitchin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any did tell her thereof: which accordingly fell out: And theſe being brought to her preſence, became obnoxious to the ordinary Means of Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                  <p>When her Glove fell down from her, at a time that ſeveral perſons were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her: it was lifted again by a Hand inviſible to them.</p>
                  <p>She was not only tranſported throw the Hall and down Stairs, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her Feet to touch the Ground: But alſo was hurried in a flight <hi>up Stairs:</hi> And when a Miniſter endeavoured to retain her; he found a ſenſible weight, beſides her own Strength, drawing her from him.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe complained, that her Tormenters had bitten and ſcratched her; the <hi>Steads</hi> of the Nails and Teeth were ſeen upon her Skin, with Blood and Spittle: about the wounds, which were above Twenty four; while neither her own, or any others Teeth that were viſible, could have done it.</p>
                  <p>She was moſt vehemently diſtorted, upon attempting to Tell, or even Write the Names of her Tormenters: yet that ceaſed as to any of them, how ſoon that perſon was <hi>aliunde</hi> delated; and particularly ſhe had liberty, after many painful Attempts, to Accuſe <hi>Margaret Laing,</hi> how ſoon a Charm of Hair to reſtrain her, which <hi>Margaret</hi> had left behind the Door, was found and burnt; the Girle having told it to have been <hi>tim,</hi> in manner mentioned in the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>

                  <p>When ſhe told, that there was ſomething tormenting her under the Cloaths; the Spectators ſaw, the Bed-cloaths <hi>move</hi> in an extraordinary manner, after the Girle had been raiſed out of them.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe complained that ſhe was Beaten: the By-ſtanders heard the <hi>Noiſe</hi> of the Stroaks</p>
                  <p>She cried out at a time, that her Theigh was hurt: And one of the Company having ſearched her Pocket, found a Knife; but unfolded: However, having folded up the ſame, and put it in a ſecond time; ſhe cries of new: And upon the ſecond ſearch, it (tho' ſecuted by the Spring) is found open, to the great wonder of the Beholders; ſince they did watch, that no viſible thing could have poſſibly opened it.</p>
                  <p>She told of a Charm under the Bed: And accordingly it was found in the the ſhape of an Egg, which melted away being put in the Fire: She told alſo, that her Siſter that was boarded abroad, had Charms put above her in the Houſe, and would not recover of the decaying Sickneſs till ſhe were brought out of it: According whereunto, the Child being brought home, ſhe ſtraight way <hi>recovered.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The Story anent her telling, That the Commiſſioners, tho' at three Miles diſtance, had granted a Warrand to the Sherriff, to apprehend one of her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters: Her telling ſo perfect an account of the Sheriff, and of Mr <hi>Guthri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You ſee that none of them do <hi>shed Tears,</hi> nor were they ever diſcovered to do it ſince their Impriſonment, notwithſtanding of their frequent Howlings: So that it is not a ſudden Grief or Surpriſe. And finally, that the Girle fell in Fits of Torment upon the Pannals approaches to her, and that ſhe did name them all frequently, either out of, or in, her Fits.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>particular,</hi> you ſee how <hi>Katharine Campbell</hi> was <hi>provoked</hi> by this Girl's diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her Thift; whereupon ſhe has brought in the reſt of her Confederets to act the following Miſchiefs: How thereupon <hi>Campbell</hi> did <hi>Curſe and Imprecate</hi> in a terrible manner: How ſhe <hi>ſtayed out of her Bed</hi> at Night, and was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>drouſie</hi> in the Morning: How ſhe was named by the Girle, particularly the two Nights that ſhe was <hi>out</hi> of Priſon: The Ball of Hair was taken out of her Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and burnt; whereupon the Girle's throwing out of Hair did <hi>ceaſe:</hi> She could not expreſs one word, even when on her Knees, of Prayer, for the Girl's Recovery: And the inſenſible Marks on her, were very remarkable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnas Naſmith</hi> did not torment the Girl <hi>after</hi> ſhe had prayed for her: She was <hi>repute</hi> a Witch, and hath the <hi>Marks.</hi> She came early in the Morning to <hi>Bargarran</hi>'s Cloſs, when by her refuſing to go in, it appeared ſhe had <hi>no buſineſs.</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35409:28"/>Yea, it is plain. that ſhe had a Reſentment, for her not getting a greater <hi>Alm's</hi> the laſt time ſhe was there. The Girl declared <hi>ex incotinenti,</hi> that <hi>Naſmith asked</hi> her Health and Age; which in theſe Circumſtances was a ſhrewd Preſumption of her evil Deſign: And ſhe acknowledged herſelf to have done this, when ſhe asked the Age of another Child; wherein by Providence the was befooled, ſince that which ſhe thought would have been an Excuſe, tended to diſcover her Gurlt.

                     <hi>Margaret Fulton</hi> was repute a VVitch, has the Mark of it; and acknowledged in preſence of her Husband, that ſhe made uſe of a <hi>Charm;</hi> which appeared full of ſmall Stones and Blood.

                  <p>As to the <hi>Lindſays</hi> they all have the Mark: And were all of a long time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be Witches. <hi>John Lindſay</hi> in <hi>Barloch</hi> was accidentally diſcovered by the Girles taking a <hi>Fit</hi> upon his coming to the Houſe. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>James Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays;</hi> were dilated by a confeſsing Witch in <hi>Anno</hi> 1687, Which Confeſsion is publickly read before you: And there was <hi>Money</hi> given to the Sheriff-depute for delaying of the purſute. <hi>James Lindſay</hi> appeared to <hi>William Semple</hi> ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and <hi>Flew about</hi> like a Fowl, for an opportunity to ſtrick him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the quarrel mentioned in the Depoſition, and at laſt prevailed to ſtrick him dead over a Dyke.

                  <p>It is true there are ſome few of the Adminicles that are proven only by one VVitneſs.

                  <p>Now upon the whole, you will take notice, that Preſumptions being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement make a more certain Probation then Witneſſes: Becauſe Preſumptions are <hi>Natural Emanations</hi> of the thing it ſelf, which cannot be brybed. Whereas Witneſſes are obnoxious: So in our Law there was one condemned for Thift, on other for falſhood, and a third for Murdering of a Child, meerly upon Preſumptions, as is related by <hi>McKeinzie</hi> in his Criminal Treatiſe: much more may preſumptions aſtruct the faith of, and take off the <hi>Nota</hi> from, <hi>poſitive Witneſſes:</hi> For it is a groſs miſtake, that ſeveral proofs, which have each of them <hi>ſome</hi> Import, may not be joyned to make a full Evidence, the ſame way as two ſmall Candles in a Dark room, will not ſuffice; yet ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being added to them, will make a ſufficient light, to diſcover the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derrer: Two Boys will be able to carry a Weight which one of them would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>VVe ſhall therefore leave you with this Concluſion, That as you ought to beware to condemn the innocent, and ought to incline to the ſafeſt fide: ſo if theſe Pannals be proven legally guilty; Then <hi>quoad bygones,</hi> your Eye ought not to ſpare them, nor ought you to ſuffer a VVitch to Live: And, <hi>as to the future;</hi> you in doing otherways would be <hi>Acceſſory</hi> to all the Blaſphemies, Apoſtacys.

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Have Collected, according to my Promiſe, what appeared to me moſt <hi>Specious</hi> in the Reaſonings, either in Court, or private Converſation, anent the receiving of the Confeſſants as Witneſſes. You are not to imagine, that the Pannals were Condemned on the <hi>Faith of theſe:</hi> For I do believe the Probation by unexceptionable witneſſes, led antecedent to this laſt, was ſo pregnant, that the Pannals might have been Condemned on it, tho' theſe laſt had not been adduced.</p>
               <p>I may have miſſed the <hi>Energy</hi> of the Argument ſometimes, in a Caſe which in it ſelf is ſo <hi>abstruſe:</hi> However, you have it in ſuch manner as <hi>I</hi> was able to penetrat thereunto; as follows.</p>
               <p>IN order to the more ſatisfactory Anſwering of the Objections made againſt theſe laſt Witneſſes, we ſhall firſt, lay before you the <hi>State</hi> of the Caſe: And, then, clear up the <hi>Determination</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>As to the Firſt. The Queſtion is not, whether <hi>Partners in the Crime,</hi> or others mentioned in the Objections, can be a Concluding Proof of <hi>themſelves,</hi> tho' two of them would concur as to the ſame Act of Witchcraft: But whether the <hi>Corpora delicti</hi> appearing already to imply Witchcraft, and the extrinſick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles being ſo pregnant, to infer that theſe Pannals are the Witches: there concurring ſuch Characters, as by obſervance of all Nations and Ages, are the Symptoms of a Witch; particularly the <hi>Marks, Fame,</hi> not ſhedding of <hi>Tears, &amp;c.</hi> which are Diſcoveries of Providence of ſo dark a Crime, that like Avenues lead us to the Secret of it. And finally, when ſix perſons of different Ages and Stations, five Confeſſants, and the Girl, do, when <hi>ſeparatly examined,</hi> agree in their Anſwers to every material Queſtion that is put to them, even tho' it be <hi>New;</hi> ſo that it could not be concerted: We ſay, whether or not in ſuch a Caſe may Witneſſes be received to put the Cape-ſtone on the Evidence by a <hi>poſitive</hi> probation, of a Matter of Fact which is the Object of Senſe, tho' other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways they be liable to exception, if ſuch Extraordinarineſs of the <hi>Corpora delicti,</hi> Clearneſs of the Adminicles, and of the Diagnoſticks of Witches; did not preceed them; as you have ſeen proven before you that they do?</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:35409:30"/>
               <p>The Caſe is not, whether theſe VVitneſſes would be Habile in an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> Crime, which <hi>commonly</hi> falls to be expoſed to other VVitneſſes, then thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it: But whether they can be received in this <hi>Extraordinary, Occult,</hi> and <hi>Excepted Crime</hi> of VVitchcraft; wherein there are two ſpecial Caſes to be noticed; <hi>viz.</hi> Sometimes the Acts thereof are open, and admitt the choiſe of VVitneſſes; ſuch as Charmes uſed in the Day-time, when the Actor is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But that part of VVitchcraft; whereby VVitches meet in the Night-time, Adore their Lord, contrive their Malefices, and accordingly thereafter execute them, when other VVitneſſes are aſleep, or the VVitches themſelves are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſight: VVe ſay, that this can be no otherways proven than by theſe that are Intimat to it, joyned to the <hi>poſitive</hi> Proof and Adminicles before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>VVe do not alledge, that Perſons <hi>altogether</hi> deſtitute of Knowledge and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience</hi> are to be admitted in any Caſe, ſuch as Infants, Furious, Fatuous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither do we contend. That <hi>Thomas Lindſay</hi> and <hi>Cliriſtian Shaw,</hi> who are under Pupillarity, ſhould be put to an Oath; for they are only to be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeparatly before the Court, upon interrogators, by which it may appear, whether or not they coincide with the four other Confeſſants, that are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone before them; and this is the <hi>Pannal's Advantage</hi> in caſe of Diſagreement: But we inſiſt, that any Perſon above Pupillarity; giving Evidences of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Knowledge and natural Conſcience (which is a ſufficient Fond for all the Credit that we need in this Caſe, that is already almoſt fully proven) is to be received as a VVitneſs.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>2d.</hi> we ſhall make this as clear as Noon. <hi>1mo.</hi> From <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the <hi>Nature</hi> of the thing. <hi>2do.</hi> The unanimous Judgment of <hi>Lawiers</hi> in all Nations and Ages. <hi>3tio.</hi> Our <hi>own</hi> Cuſtoms and Deciſions. And <hi>4to.</hi> The <hi>Singularity</hi> of this Circumſtantiat Caſe.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Firſt.</hi> The going to, and coming from Meetings, eſpecially on <hi>Foot;</hi> the falling down, and worſhiping the Devil there, under a <hi>Corporeal</hi> ſhape (which he had when he tempted our SAVIOUR to doit) The actual <hi>Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Children by a Cord and Napkin; and the <hi>Tormenting</hi> of Others by Pins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are plain Objects of Senſe: And therefore the Senſes are to be beleiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anent them. For as <hi>Reaſon</hi> hath Things Intelligible; and <hi>Faith</hi> Things Supernatural; ſo the Senſes have Things Corporeal for their Object, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent they are to be truſted, ay and while it be <hi>Proven,</hi> that the <hi>Appearance</hi> is <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> or that the Witneſs of it, is an <hi>Impoſtor.</hi> It is an part of the Witches Purchaſe from the Devil, that they cannot be ſeen at ſome occaſions: So that the Abominations comitted <hi>then</hi> would remain unpuniſhed, if ſuch VVitneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were not admitted. It cannot be thought that VVitches (who of all Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals are the moſt <hi>obſtinat to Confeſs</hi>) would venture the loſs of their own Lives, by deponing againſt Others, againſt whom they have <hi>no ſpecial picque;</hi> yea, for whom they have particular <hi>Affection,</hi> as ſeveral of the Pannalls are ſome of the VVitneſſes Relations. Nor has the Devil any <hi>peculiar</hi> intereſt to Inſtigat them thereunto: For ſeverals of the Pannalls have confeſſed <hi>other execrable Crymes:</hi> VVhereby it cannot be ſuppoſed, That Satan would be divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf. GOD in his ordinary Providence has taken ſuch care of publick Judgments, that the Enemy of Juſtice his <hi>ſpecial Power</hi> ceaſes thereabout, as appears by the VVitches not being able either to do more Harm, or eſcape, after GOD's Miniſters begin to counteract Satan's Inſtruments by Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And finally, the oddneſs of the Malefices, the Concurrence of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35409:31"/>Adminicles; and the exiſtence of Matters of Fact, wherein theſe Confeſſants (tho' not knowing the ſame otherways) do <hi>agree with other</hi> unexceptionable VVitneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do ſufficiently aſtruct their Credibility: For as Falſhood being a Crime, is never preſumed; ſo a perſon found true in many things, is ſtill preſumed to continue ſuch, till the contrary be evinced.</p>

This is not a common Author, but a Man who as Curious, was Exact: As Prudent did not publiſh ſuch things without the Approbation of the beſt Divines and Lawiers; as a Prince, is to be Credited anent the Law of His own Countrey; and as a King has determined any Dubiety that might have remained in this Point, alſo farr as the Law of our Government will permitt.</p>
               <p>But further our Judges and Lawiers have followed His Majeſty: For in all the Proceſſes in the Journals; Fame, and Delation, and the <hi>Mack,</hi> are ſtill ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as moſt pregnant Preſumptions; whereupon, and a very ſmall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation beſides, Witches have been frequently Condemned.

                  <hi>others inhabile,</hi> were admitted; particularly in Treaſon and in Falſhood: And all Lawiers conclude, That witchcraft is as much an <hi>excepted</hi> crime as theſe.</p>
               <p>As to the 4th. VVhat ever inhability theſe witneſſes might be under, it is fully made up, and they rendred unexceptionably Habile <hi>by the Chain</hi> of this whole Buſineſs It is true <hi>one</hi> Man throw the concurrence of corroſive Humors, may have an inſenſible Mark; <hi>another</hi> be enviouſly defamed: A <hi>Third</hi> may through ſudden Grief or Melancholy, not be able to weep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Fourth</hi> may be load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuſpitious Circumſtances, when extraordinary things fall out in the Countrey: And a <hi>Fifth</hi> may be deponed againſt by two falſe witneſſes, tho' neither of theſe ſeparatly be truely witches. But by the known Obſervation and Experience of <hi>Mankind,</hi> none except witches have had the unhappie Medley and Concurſe of <hi>All</hi> or <hi>Moſt</hi> of theſe <hi>Indicia,</hi> and ordinarly, and for the <hi>greater part,</hi> Witches have them: So that ſince the Rules of Judgment are eſtabliſhed upon that, <hi>Quod plerumque fit,</hi> which does obtain <hi>till an exception</hi> be apparent in a ſpecial caſe, the Conjunction of theſe in <hi>one perſon,</hi> does as plainly give his Character, as the moſt certain ſymptoms of the plaineſt Diſeaſe, being univerſally concerted in all parts of the World, points out to us that the Haver of them is a perſon truely affected with that Deſeaſe, whereof he hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Diagnoſticks. In a word, one or other of theſe may concurr, in the Innocent; but no Writers do <hi>Atteſt,</hi> that <hi>all of them</hi> have concentred in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon in the World but a witch: And on the other hand, they taking place in Witches, through <hi>all parts of the World,</hi> muſt proceed from a <hi>common,</hi> and not from a peculiar Humor or Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſpecifick Aptitude;</hi> of ſome of the niceſt of the <hi>Indicia,</hi> which appeared from the Probation already led, to diſcover a Witch, do ſerve to clear the ground of the Worldes Obſervation anent them.

                  </gap>des that, commonly this mark being given at the <hi>firſt Meeting,</hi> does by its intolerable Pain, force the Witch to a ſecond Randevouz for curing it, at which the poor wretch being under this furious neceſſity, fixes the Paction by renewing it with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eliberation, having been <hi>diverted</hi> in the mean time from conſidering the Horridneſs of the firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement by the <hi>Pain.</hi> The inability to ſhed Tears may be a Charactriſtick of <hi>Hardening,</hi> tho' not always in the caſe of Chriſtians; yet in theſe who have ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſuch; left the Devil giving them ſuch words of Scripture and Prayer as many have, it ſhould be impoſſible to diſcover their Hypocriſy; and that is not Satan's own intereſt, ſince by this Diſcovery occaſion is given to Buffo on the Profeſſion of Holyneſs. A Report often ariſes without ground, but a <hi>Conſtant Ropuce</hi> that keeps footing, implyes for the moſt part a ſurer Cauſe; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when it is of Perſons below Envy; and by Perſons above Calumny. The Girls falling in fitts at approach of the Pannalls might proceed from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie,</hi> arriſeing from the poiſonous Steems of the witch <hi>accuſtom'd</hi> to produce that Effect through a vertue affixed thereto by the Devil, by Conjunction of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes (the ſame way as the inviſible Peſtilence does operat) or his <hi>promiſe</hi> of caſting the Girl in Fitts at the Witches preſence, might have been <hi>General;</hi> where by the Witch was eventually befooled and diſcovered, as it often falls out: For Satan envies even their temporal Felicity, and fears leſt by continuing here, they ſhould be reſt out of his hands by Converſion. When they come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Deluſion of his Promiſes to make them rich and the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was one thing further which was tried before your Lordſhips, <hi>viz.</hi> None of the Pannals that were tried (tho' moſt Saggacious and Knowing, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35409:32"/>perfect in Memory, ſo that it could not proceed from Ignorance or Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs) could make out the attempt of ſaying the Lord's Prayer; which may either be a <hi>ſecret Judgement</hi> for Renuncing their firſt LORD, after whom it is peculiarly Denominat, or by <hi>restraint</hi> of their new lord, who may think that <hi>too ſpecial an Homage</hi> to his Adverſary. But we have hindered you too long with that which is not neceſſary: For this being incontravertible <hi>Law</hi> and Cuſtom, there needs no Philoſophy to ſupport it: Since Legiſlators do Reaſon, but Subjects muſt Obey: And both the Fool and the Lazie (who have neither <hi>Read</hi> nor <hi>Thought</hi> enough to underſtand this Subject) are to be left to their own Chimera's: Yet leſt they ſhould <hi>inſult,</hi> we ſhall Anſwer in their faſhion, ſuch of the Objections as the Pannals Advocate thought any ways worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in this place.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is objected, that <hi>Delrio Sect.</hi> 5. § 4. ſays, That <hi>Socii</hi> are not to be admitted witneſſes <hi>ad condemnandum;</hi> eſpecially conſidering, that the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be <hi>luce meridiana clarior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is anſwered, that the place it ſelf confutes this Inference in the preſent Caſe: For it ſays, <hi>Ex</hi> his ſolis <hi>non eſt procedendum ad condemnationem, ſcio contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium communius teneri &amp; in praxi obtinere,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is evident, <hi>1mo.</hi> That the common Opinion and Cuſtom is in the contrary, even when there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther probation, but by the Partners of the Crime. Yet, <hi>2do.</hi> we are not ſo ſtraitned but ſubſume in his very words, <hi>ex his ſolis</hi> we do not deſire the Pannals ſhould be Condemned; but your Lordſhips ſee theſe Witneſſes we are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce are not <hi>ſoli</hi> or <hi>alone;</hi> for the Probation led theſe laſt Sixteen Hours, are ſo many <hi>Concomitants</hi> and Diſcoveries of Providence, which aſtruct and make up any defect in their Credit that can be deſiderat. Hence, <hi>3tio.</hi> The Meaning of that Maxim (which is Metaphorical, as appears by the words, Clarior <hi>luce meridiana,</hi> an <hi>equal</hi> Clearneſs being ſufficient) is fully Anſwered, and takes place in the preſent Caſe: For the Extraordinarineſs of the <hi>Corpora delicti,</hi> Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of the Adminicles, and Pointedneſs of the poſitive Probation, being conjoined; there is not a Clearer Proof upon Record in any Nation, than that to which, it's hoped, theſe will amount.</p>
               <p>Whereas this Alledgance is enforced, by pretending it were of dangerous conſequences to allow ſuch witneſſes to prove meeting with the Devil, ſince Satan might have repreſented others by their <hi>falſe shapes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Anſwered.</p>
               <p>
